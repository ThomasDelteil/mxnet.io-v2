Crash Course
============

This crash course will give you a quick overview of the core concept of NDArray
(manipulating multiple dimensional arrays) and Gluon (create and train neural
networks). This is a good place to start if you are already familiar with
machine learning or other deep learning frameworks.

   You can also watch the video tutorials for this crash course. Note that two APIs
   described in vidoes have changes:

   - ``with name_scope`` is not necessary any more.
   - use ``save_parameters/load_parameters`` instead of ``save_params/load_params``
