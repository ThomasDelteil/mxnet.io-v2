mxnet.symbol
=========================

The Symbol API in Apache MXNet is an interface for symbolic programming. It features the use of computational graphs, reduced memory usage, and pre-use function optimization.


Example
-------

The following example shows how you might build a simple expression with the Symbol API.

.. code-block:: python

	import mxnet as mx
	# Two placeholers are created with mx.sym.variable
	a = mx.sym.Variable('a')
	b = mx.sym.Variable('b')
	# The symbol is constructed using the '+' operator
	c = a + b
	(a, b, c)
