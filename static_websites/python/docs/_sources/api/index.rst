Overview
--------

This API section details functions, modules, and objects included in MXNet,
describing what they are and what they do. The APIs are grouped into the
following categories:


.. container:: cards

   .. card::
      :title: NDArray module
      :link: ndarray/index.html

      Imperative APIs to manipulate multi-dimensional arrays.

   .. card::
      :title: Gluon module
      :link: gluon/index.html

      Imperative APIs to load data, construct and train neural networks.

   .. card::
      :title: Gluon-related modules
      :link: gluon-related/index.html

      Modules, including context and optimizer, that can be used with Gluon.

   .. card::
      :title: Symbol module
      :link: symbol/index.html

      Symbolic APIs for multi-dimensional arrays and neural network layers.

   .. card::
